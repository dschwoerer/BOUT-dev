Examples
========

The code and input files in the ``examples/`` subdirectory are for
research, demonstrating BOUT++, and to check for broken functionality.
Some proper unit tests have been implemented, but this is something
which needs improving. The examples which were published in
[Dudson2009]_ were ``drift-instability``, ``interchange-instability``
and ``orszag-tang``.

The model in ``gas_compress.cxx`` solves the compressible gas dynamics
equations for the density :math:`n`, velocity :math:`\mathbf{V}`, and
pressure :math:`P`:

drift-instability
-----------------

The physics code ``2fluid.cxx`` implements a set of reduced Braginskii
2-fluid equations, similar to those solved by the original BOUT code.
This evolves 6 variables: Density, electron and ion temperatures,
parallel ion velocity, parallel current density and vorticity.

Input grid files are the same as the original BOUT code, but the output
format is different.

   Interchange instability test. Solid lines are from analytic theory,
   symbols from BOUT++ simulations, and the RMS density is averaged over
   :math:`z`. Vertical dashed line marks the reference point, where
   analytic and simulation results are set equal

orszag-tang

The file ``mhd.cxx`` solves the full MHD equations for the full values
(perturbation + initial), whilst the file ``mhd_perturb.cxx`` solves for
a perturbation about the equilibrium.
