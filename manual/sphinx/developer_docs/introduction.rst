This section describes the core of BOUT++, and is intended for anyone who wants
to work on improving BOUT++. It does its best to describe the details of how
BOUT++ works, and assumes that the user is very comfortable with C++. For a
general introduction, and instructions for using BOUT++ see the :ref:`User guide
<sec-userguide>`. The userâ€™s guide assumes only minimal knowledge of C++, and
provides only those details needed to use BOUT++.

We use doxygen comments to document the code in the source files. This is then
built using breathe_ and sphinx_ into the document you're reading now. The
API documentation is in :doc:`../_breathe_autogen/classlist`.
