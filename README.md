A modular fluid simulation code written in C++.
Adapted from the original BOUT 3D 2-fluid simulation code.
Aims to be able to solve a wide variety of fluid models in
almost any curvilinear coordinate system.

Developed by B.Dudson (University of York) and M.Umansky (LLNL)
based on the original BOUT code by X.Xu (LLNL)
Further development by S.Farley (ANL) for coupling to PETSc and FACETS
